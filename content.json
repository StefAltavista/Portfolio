The aim of the network was to let oganizations comunicate, bound and collaborate more fluently, since this is often a delicate process. It was created during a programming bootcamp as an Excercise but then took more and more hape and became an official website. Noises is now also an onsubtitle calendar where users can very simply view the published events and organizers profile, withut the need of signing in. Its free Platform that promotes alternative and countercoulture. S.A.M. created this platform also to be used for his own Label Autonoma Industrile, as most of the event promotion platform are nowadays controlled by mediatic and commercial algorythms that as a matter of fact do not push for cultural development but anihilation of individuality for the subsitence and groth of a manipulated society.  Since there is big social movement in the realm of avantgarde, unconventional and extreme art Noises wants to give a voice to the underdogs, that have always been the foundation of our society and now need to reclaim their space.",
