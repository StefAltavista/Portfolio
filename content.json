        "description": "Noises was born as a social network for music labels, event organizers and promoters of the Berlin Noise, underground Techno and Experimental music scene. The aim of the network was to let oganizations comunicate, connect and collaborate more fluently, since this is often a delicate process. Noises is now also an online calendar where users can view published events and organizers profiles without the need of signing in. It's a free Platform that promotes alternative and countercoulture. S.A.M. created this platform to be used for his own Label Autonoma Industrile, as most of the current event promotion platforms are controlled by mediatic and commercial algorythms that do not push for cultural development but instead for the anihilation of individuality and for the subsitence and growth of a manipulated society. Since there is a big social movement in the realm of avantgarde, unconventional and extreme art, Noises wants to give a voice to the underdogs that have always been the foundation of our society and now need to reclaim their space. \n S.A.M has put together a team to further develope this platform, and it will soon be launched.",

Once the picture is saved the user can access his own gallery, and mint each of those immages into the Polygon chain. With the aid of NFTport API, the user can also query The Ethereum and Poligon blockchain to visualize the NFTS that belong to a given wallet address. The user can access the website with his personal crypto wallet through Metamask. The website is available but also is still being developped.",
